/*
A heap table is a table without a clusteres index. 
In common, using heap tables isn't best practice, only in some less szenarios a heap is acceptable.
In SQL Azure heap tables are not allowed, every table must have a clustered index. So if you want to migrate you SQL Server database to SQL Azure you have to define a clustered index or modify an existing index for all table, where no CI exists.
With this simple Transact-SQL statement you can query all heap tables.

Works with SQL Server 2005 and higher version with all editions.
